<h1>Classic EForth</h1>

{{MENU}}

<p>
EForth is a delightfully minimalist approach to Forth originated by Bill Muench and Dr. C. H. Ting.

<h3>Classic EForth Quirks</h3>

<p>
EForth exclusively uses <code>FOR..NEXT</code> in favor of <code>DO..LOOP</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/eForth-FOR-..-NEXT">Details</a>
</p>

<p>
This construct has the odd property that it iterates one "extra" time for zero.
</p>

<pre>
: FOO 10 FOR R@ . NEXT ; FOO
 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  ok
</pre>

<p>
To permit a more ordinary loop the <code>AFT</code> word is used in the sequence
<code>FOR..AFT..THEN..NEXT</code>.
</p>

<pre>
: FOO 10 FOR ( 1st time only ) AFT R@ . THEN NEXT ; FOO
 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  ok
</pre>

<p>
The even more enigmatic <code>FOR..WHILE..NEXT..ELSE..THEN</code>
is used in place of <code>DO..LEAVE..LOOP</code>.
It allows a while condition to early out of a counted loop.
