<h3>Windows &amp; Linux Calling</h3>

<p>
As unfortunately both Windows and Linux have system and library calls with
as many as 10 parameters (for example <code>XCreateImage</code>),
a collection of calling thunks is required.
A single varidic thunk would be ideal, but is hard to do without per platform
assembly language.

<pre>
CALL0 ( fn -- n )
CALL1 ( n fn -- n )
CALL2 ( n n fn -- n )
CALL3 ( n n n fn -- n )
CALL4 ( n n n n fn -- n )
CALL5 ( n n n n n fn -- n )
CALL6 ( n n n n n n fn -- n )
CALL7 ( n n n n n n n fn -- n )
CALL7 ( n n n n n n n n fn -- n )
CALL9 ( n n n n n n n n n fn -- n )
CALL10 ( n n n n n n n n n n fn -- n )
