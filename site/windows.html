µEforth for Windows</h1>
Unfortunately, Window Defender's heuristics falsely identify uEforth.exe builds as malware.
And recently Google Cloud also started identifying them as abuse.
As a result, I've removed hosting of them.
</p>

<p>
Instead build as follows (using the Windows Subsystem for Linux):
<pre>
sudo apt install ninja-build
git clone https://github.com/flagxor/ueforth
cd ueforth
./configure.py
ninja
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Windows Opcodes</h4>

<p>
The wealth of Windows .DLL and system functionality can be
accessed via the dynamic loading interface.
A handle to a library is obtained with <code>LOADLIBRARYA</code>,
and then individual symbols are accessed with <code>GETPROCADDRESS</code>.
</p>

<pre>
LOADLIBRARYA ( dllname-z -- module )
GETPROCADDRESS ( module name-z -- fn )
</pre>

<p>
And assembly version of <code>*/MOD</code> is provided to allow the EXE to build without
including MSVCRT.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/flagxor/ueforth/blob/main/windows/windows_main.c">windows_main.c</a>.
</p>

<p>
Native functions all called with CALL(n) (see Windows &amp; Linux Calling below).
</p>

<h4>Windows Imports</h4>

<p>
Various Win32 calls are imported in
<a href="https://github.com/flagxor/ueforth/blob/main/windows/windows.fs">windows.fs</a>.
In addition, a terminal that responds to ANSI escape codes is created and connected to
<code>TYPE</code> and <code>KEY</code>.
